# SPRINT 1
- The score evaluation within the Sprint was determined as 10.
- Score completion logic: The backlog score to be completed throughout the project is 30. The number of points to be completed for the first Sprint was determined as 10 and the target was achieved.
Daily Scrum: Meetings were held via Discord. Two groups were created as the Design Group and the Coder Group.
----------------
- Design and Development Logic: The design side will also work on the developing side. The team found it appropriate to create a separate group in order to fully integrate the design language in Sprints 1 and 2.

- Design Group Members: Esma, Esad, Emre.
